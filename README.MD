LasarOS - Open Source for patient care (more cost-effective than Apotti)

1. Purpose of this project

The purpose of LasarOS is to build an open source patient care "operating system". LasarOS refers both to Lasaros (https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasaros) and to OS, which is an abbreviation of both Open Source and Operating System. 

The motivation for this project comes from the Finnish megalomaniac waterfall project called "Apotti", which is a patient knowledge system to be released in the distance future. However, LasarOS isn't dedicated for Finland or any other country specifically, because its independent of regulations and laws that concern a specific country. Instead, it complies with "common law" and a rule that saving human life is more important than trying to obey all possible regulations and especially interpretations of the regulations. 

Also, some major differences between Apotti and LasarOS:

* Apotti is a 600Mâ‚¬ project, LasarOS has virtually 0 budget
* Apotti is closed source, LasarOS is open source
* Apotti is not (!!) a software project, LasarOS is a software project
* Apotti cares about privacy, LasarOS cares about human life
* Apotti is going to be finished 2021 (?!), LasarOS has no schedule (constant development, maybe?)

The main idea behind LasarOS is that a patient can share his own information whenever it provides him acute medical 
help. Also, he can even make his medical information public if he wishes so. Or choose the level or privacy depending on
instances, medical personnels or different facilities. That is, it also works as a "Wiki", where the patient can maintain
his own medical history. However, on the other hand the official information is also available for medical personnel and
instances that need to access it to provide patient the best possible medical care. Official information and patient's own
information are separate. 

To put it simple: LasarOS aims all the time to provide best possible information to provide the patient best possible
medical care in all situations. In an emergency situation that threatens patient's life, it's always better to get all
necessary information as quickly and easily as possible even if there is a privacy issue. Saving human life is more important
than maintaining privacy. (Privacy is important too!)

2. Technical considerations
LasarOS is technically build on the Linnovate's open source MEAN (MEAN.IO) stack template:  https://github.com/linnovate/mean
MEAN.IO is licensed under the MIT License (Copyright (C) 2012-2014 Linnovate Technologies)

4. Considerations against "worst case" scenerios

LasarOS will be prepared against different forms of attacks including DDOS, trojans, ransomware, WannaCry etc.

The main principle is that the maintainer / owner of LasarOS has all time full control and understanding of the system.
It won't be something running in cloud (i.e. in someone else's computer) that could be put as ransomware if gained 
control over.
